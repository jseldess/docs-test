This document describes how to configure pay-as-you-go billing for your Pinecone organization through Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketplace. To commit to annual spending, [contact Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/contact).

> ℹ️  Note
>
> This workflow creates a new Pinecone [organization](organizations). If you already have an organization, signing up through GCP Marketplace creates an additional organization. 

To configure Pinecone billing through the GCP Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace). Your project must be enabled for purchase by your billing administrator.
1. Search for the [Pinecone listing](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/pinecone-public/pinecone).
1. Click **Subscribe**.
1. Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
1. Click **Subscribe**.
1. On the **Your order request has been sent to Pinecone** dialog, click **Sign up with Pinecone**.
1. On the **You're leaving Google** dialog, click **OK**. This takes you to the Pinecone sign-in page.
1. Sign in to Pinecone.io.

When you sign in, Pinecone creates a new organization linked to your GCP billing.

If you already have a Pinecone organization, you can select the new "GCP Linked" organization in the organization drop-down menu in the console.
