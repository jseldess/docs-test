If you are a [project](/docs/projects) or [organization](/docs/organizations) owner, follow these steps to add users to organizations and projects. 

## Add users to projects and organizations

1. Access the [Pinecone Console](https://app.pinecone.io).

1. Click **Settings** in the left menu.

1. In the **Settings** view, click the **USERS** tab.

1. Click **+INVITE USER**.

1. (Organization owner only) Select an [organization role](organizations#organization-roles).

1. Select one or more projects.

1. Select a [project role](projects#project-roles).

1. Enter the user's email address.

1. Click **+INVITE USER**.

When you invite another user to join your organization or project, Pinecone sends them an email containing a link that enables them to gain access to the organization or project. If they already have a Pinecone account, they still receive an email, but they can also immediately view the project.
